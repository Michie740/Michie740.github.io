                    <b> A Ferocious Battle </b> 
                    <br><br>
                    Braver than flying rats <br>
                    More cowardly than pizza rats <br>
                    It circles the blanket as <br>
                    light falls through the still-wet leaves  <br>
                    of the still-wet trees <br>
                    surrounding us. <br>
                    (like a spotlight on a ring) <br>
                    (like we are fighters sizing each other <br>
                    up) <br>
                    (like a sheriff and a bandit in the Wild West) <br>
                    <br>
                    Do I throw something? <br>
                    one arm raises, ready to attack <br>
                    Do I defend? <br>
                    its tail rustles, eyes dont <br>
                    break contact <br>
                    Do I move? <br>
                    one ear twitches, waiting for one mistake <br>
                    <br>
                    I put down my food.<br>
                    eyes narrow<br>
                    Tension swells.<br>
                    inches closer<br>
                    I raise my umbrella.<br>
                    pause<br>
                    The umbrella e x p a n d s.<br>
                    silence<br>
                    .<br>
                    I lower it.<br>
                    It’s gone.<br>
                    Tree rats will not win today.<br>

                    <br><br>
                    A looming presence with an icy inside <br>
                    holding what keeps me alive. <br>
                    <br>
                    Mostly empty it stays <br>
                    in this foreign space <br>
                    always just one door away.<br>
                    <br>
                    It has one job, and does it very well<br>
                    to hold all its contents in its freezing prison cell.<br>
                    <br>
                    ‘Free the prisoners!’ It calls, day after day,<br>
                    when I’m hungry, or I’m bored, or I’m making mistakes.<br>
                    <br>
                    And mistakes I make, when my willpower breaks,<br>
                    And I open the door to greet my gluttonous fate.<br>

                    <br><br>
                    Take a look around, what do you see?<br>
                    Coffee, Croissants, Waffles, and Tea<br>
                    Instagram foodies and people on dates,<br>
                    Students with laptops and workers who wait.<br>
                    <br>
                    Smooth sounds flow through the open air<br>
                    following the aroma of espresso, always there.<br>
                    There would be a meet cute, if this were a show<br>
                    It’s nice to think about - it won’t happen though.<br>
                    <br>
                    String lights on wooden walls and art in ceramic cups.<br>
                    Just what about it is there, to be so fond of?<br>
                    Is it the overpriced food or the immaculate vibes?<br>
                    Or the breath-taking aesthetics that pleases the eye?<br>
                    <br>
                    What is it that I’m so fond of, just what?<br>
                    I sit down and waves of nostalgia fill me up -<br>
                    Of sweet moments and fun and laughs without reason<br>
                    and memories of friends and college app season.<br>
                    <br>
                    And that’s when it hits me, that mysterious reason,<br>
                    it once was my own personal Eden.<br>
                    Sit here with me and then maybe you’ll see,<br>
                    there’s more to this place than just coffee and tea.<br>

                        so easy<br>
                    to talk about everything anything nothing<br>
                    A budding sensation sneaks up<br>
                    <br>
                    and makes the world be a little brighter<br>
                        it’s<br>
                        so pretty<br>
                    to dream of yesterday reminisce tomorrow<br>
                    A stroke of serendipity <br>
                    <br>
                    maybe that created happier months<br>
                        it’s<br>
                        so welcome<br>
                    to be comfortable in silence with rosy cheeks <br>
                    And a rosier heart inside<br>
                    <br>
                    which speeds up and beats a little quicker<br>
                        it’s<br>
                        so thrilling<br>
                    to daydream about worlds of possibilities<br>
                    But for now, this much is enough<br>

                    In a forest shrouded with mystery <br>
                    where a wake of creatures have come to weep <br>
                    lay a girl with ethereal beauty<br>
                    calm and serene, cursed to eternal sleep<br>
                    <br>
                    A curse from her own naive desire<br>
                    when the sin of temptation grew too much<br>
                    the blood red apple she had to acquire <br>
                    and take a bite of soon as it was touched <br>
    
                    In a glass coffin she lays, still breathing<br>
                    unbeknownst to the sorrow in the air<br>
                    they lament: no more clandestine meetings<br>
                    but still, she's here, even now, the most fair <br>
                    <br>
                    And here she waits, in this prison built with love<br>
                    cold and unfeeling, like the stars above <br>
