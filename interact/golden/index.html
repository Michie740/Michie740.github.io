                    The sky is blue, sun glowing over the building tops <br>
                    Countdown, less than twenty minutes on the clock <br>
                    Thirteen tons suspended over a raging roaring river <br>
                    Empty walkways, except for you and me, together <br>
                    The ground shakes, as trains rumble past <br>
                    Like an earthquake - nature's most destructive craft <br>
                </div>
                <div class = "sky" id = "bluegold">
                    Blue fades into gold, sun peeking over the building tops <br>
                    We walk side by side, wind and music to us, just props <br>
                    At the middle, at the crest, we stop - halfway <br>
                    Cameras out, ready to capture, it’s almost cliche <br>
                    Two times a day, an hour each, so easily missed <br>
                    A fleeting instance, but a time of certified bliss <br>
                </div>
                <div class = "sky" id = "gold">
                    The sky is golden, sun hidden behind the building tops <br>
                    A tranquil air settles, and just for us, time stops <br>
                    Soft streaks paint portraits across the sky <br>
                    But with you, it’s a masterpiece, and maybe that’s why <br>
                    I take a picture, capture this moment before it can pass <br>
                    Because life goes on and memories fade, but this picture, it will last. <br>
